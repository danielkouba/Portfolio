		<h3>Hello!</h3>
		<p>I am a tinkerer, maker, hacker and professional photographer. Since I was young I've always wondered how things work. I discovered photography as a mix of physics, chemistry and now digital technology. My passion is in discarded and out-moded technology, like pen plotters or old projectors. I am currently learning how to become a web developer to make my ideas come to life.</p>
